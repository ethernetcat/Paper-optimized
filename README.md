Paper-optimized-configuration
===========

Optimized configuration for the High performance Spigot fork Paper provided by PaperMC.  This configuration was created for MCPlayNetwork of a personal project.  I do not take any responsibility if problems occur using this configuration.  We will try to keep this configuration as current as possible and improve it, but it is not a duty.

Note
------
There is no configuration suitable for all servers.  The configuration file published here only optimizes the configuration that is causing the TPS to drop.  If you use it, be sure to edit it according to your own server.

Branch
------
You can get different versions of the optimization config by switching branches.
